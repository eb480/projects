<h2>What are Bats?</h2>
	Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera and use their forelimbs as wings. They are actually the only mammals that can naturally fly for long periods of time. Bats are even more manoeuvrable than birds and fly with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane. Many bats feed on insects, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters). 	Only a few species, like the vampire bats, feed on animals other than insects. Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges, such as caves. Many bats live in large colonies, and some are even found in colonies of a million. Bats are present throughout the world other than extremely cold regions. Microbats and a few megabats emit ultrasonic sounds to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localise, and classify their prey in darkness.

<h2>Common Misconceptions and Myths:</h2>
1) All bats carry rabies.
<div>
<strong>Actually, bats with rabies usually behave weirdly, appear weak, and die, so it is highly unlikely that a bat will ever transmit rabies to you or your pets as long as you don't touch it.</strong>
<div>
2)Bats get tangled in hair.
<div>
<strong>Using echolocation, bats can detect the smallest object, including hair! So, it's highly unlikely that a bat would fly into your hair.</strong>
<div>
3) Bats like to suck people's blood.
<div>
<strong>Only the vampire bat drinks blood, and it usually consumes blood from sleeping animals, such as cows, pigs, and horses.</strong>
<div>
4) Bats have commonly been associated with folklore, so people of many cultures perceive them as malevolent forces.
<div>
<strong>However, bats have proven to be beneficial in many societies. As we move away from the days of myth to those of science and technology,
<div>
  we must not let fear rooted in fiction determine our actions.</strong>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<div>
1)Bats pollinate flowers and act as insecticide. They basically serve as more than $3.7 billion worth of pest control each year in the U.S. When bats consume insects, there are fewer insects damaging crops, and farmers don't have to invest as much in pesticides.
<div>
2)Fruit-eating bats play important roles in distributing seeds to maintain plants and forests. Over 300 species of fruit depend on bats for pollination. Bats help spread seeds for nuts, figs and cacao.
<div>
3)Bats benefit caves by providing important nutrients in their guano, which serves as fertilizer, that support the growth of communities of cave organisms.
<div>
4) Bats have led to amazing improvements in science and technology. About 80 medicines come from plants that rely on bats for their survival, and bats have led to advances in vaccines. Techology inspired by bats could even help blind people navigate with sound.

<h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
<div>
1) Bats arenâ€™t actually blind, and bigger bats can even see better than humans. However, if they were to guide themselves simply based on vision rather than echolocation, bats could fly into a window because they saw light inside.
<div>
2) Bats are some of the most communicative mammals and produce calls to attract mates, find roost partners, and defend resources. These calls are typically low-frequency and can travel long distances. Some bat species can also communicate through odor and bodily secretion.
<div>
3) There are over a thousand different species of bats! These are grouped into just two types: megabats or microbats.
<div>
4) The Kitti Hog-Nosed Bat, or the Bumblebee Bat, is arguably the smallest mammal.
<div>
5) Bats can live for over 20 years.
<div>
6)Some bats hibernate, while others migrate to warmer areas. For example, the spotted bat can only survive by migrating in search of food.
<div>
7) More than 6.5 million bats have died so far from White-Nose Syndrome, which is a white fungus that appears on their wings and muzzle.
<div>
8) Bats can reach speeds over 100 miles per hour!
<div>
9) Baby bats are called pups, and mothers only give birth to one bat per year. Mothers feed their pups breastmilk like other mammals.
<div>
10) Conservation efforts are helping bats recover, and there are now 200,000 bats at 75 known roosts.
